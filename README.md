git-diff
========

This is a simple PHP library to render Git diff output as `div`-based HTML output. Features:

* Clipboard copy from either side (often diff libraries intermingle left/right, making copying difficult)
* Line numbering
* Sections without changes are indicated
* CSS output is easily restyled

A demo file is included to show how it can be called.
